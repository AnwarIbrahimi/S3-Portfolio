## Learning Outcomes 

### Outcome 1: You design and build user-friendly, full stack web applications
You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

#### What does this learning outcome mean?
You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g.,
Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For this Learning Outcome i will create a full stack web application which consists of a backend and frontend. For the frontend i will be using React as the framework. I'm also using the movie database API to get up to date movies and series. For the backend i'm using Springboot and i will also make my own REST API. 

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?
For this learning outcome i started with doing research in the frameworks and best practices. You can find the research down below with links to the research document. After i was done with the research i started by watching a **Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkVpb_8IPUM&t=5488s** and followed this example to start my own backed project with springboot. after some testing and following the examples i had a base idea of how things worked in the backend. After this i switched to the frontend which i used **React** for. Since i'm using an API to get the movies and series for my application i started out with this. I used **AXIOS** to make API calls. example of these calls where documented by the Online API i found **themoviedb** https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction. After i made the connection with the API i started working on the frontend. I started with the homepage and from there out i had a foundation for my application. from there out i expanded the application bit by bit.

For the frontend i chose Javascript and for the framework react. More on why i chose this you can find in my research with the link below.
- [Frontend Development](https://github.com/AnwarIbrahimi/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Research.md#frontend-development)

For the backend i went with java as this was a new language for me and i wanted to learn something new. And for the framework i went with springboot. More on this and why i chose this you can find in the link below.

### Outcome 2: You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.
#### What does this learning outcome mean?
Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as
well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For this Learning Outcome i will assure software quality and tools to make that work. In order to make that work i will need to make different kinds of tests. Which exact tests this will be i need to look more into. This will be functional and non-functional tests. Part of this will also be automation tests. To assure this i will implement a CI/CD pipeline with github actions. I also need to look at what test i will use for the different parts in my project.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?
Nothing atm.

### Outcome 3: You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project
#### What does this learning outcome mean?
You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on
well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.

Agile is a way or approach to project manegement for developers that helps projects and the people that are working on it. An agile team works in smaller sprints usually around 3 or 4 weeks. a sprint consist out of a sprint backlog, daily standups, sprint review and a retrospective.
![agile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99720686/169487945-b38a0a34-8bd1-4ca0-b48c-5133b7043daa.jpg)

There also is a **agile manifesto** which outlines 4 values and 12 principles one example of this is: **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools. There also is the scrum model. This is a way of working with fixed iterations that give agile teams a framework for producing software with regular feedback and feedback is one of the most important thingw if it comes to working with agile.

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For thid learning outcome i will work with agile principles and methods and improve myself during the semester. In order to achieve this me and the group use some of the popular agile methods like product backlog, sprint backlogs, sprint reviews, retrospectives and daily standups. besides that i will do research in agile and make a report of my findings.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?
To use agile methods and principles in the group we use github. In github we make use of a **sprint backlog**. We made user stories as issues. We are also making use of a **product backlog**. This is defined in a board. This board is being updated at the start of every sprint. Below you can find the links of the backlogs. At the end of sprint we do a sprint review. To do this we make a powerpoint with the the tasks we planned to do at the start of the sprint and what we succeeded at the end of the sprint. We also reflect on the sprint. All this we do in front of the client and we get feedback from them. This feedback is documented and we also take this into the retrospective. As scrummaster in a retropsective i make sure that everyone understands what the meeting means and that the meeting doesn't take too long.

- [Sprint Backlog](https://github.com/AnwarIbrahimi/Netmatch/projects/3)

This is an extra step we do with user stories besides that we have a overview with all the user stories we go into depth with what a user story exactly is 
and what the steps are to complete one.

### Outcome 4: You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.
#### What does this learning outcome mean?
You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For this Learning Outcome i will implement CI/CD with github actions. I will also will be using Docker Desktop for the Docker container. 

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?
For tis learning outcome i started out by doing some research in CI/CD and what CI/CD exactly does. I started out by reading through the **Canvas Module**. from there out i looked for best practices. Since i was already used Github for my project the best practice for me would be to use github actions to implement CI/CD. Now that i made my choice on what to use i started out by following a tutorial and implemented CI/CD. i used **Docker Desktop** to build the container. There were some problems along the way during the implementation. one problem whas that it just didn't wannted to build when deploying it. after some searching on google i found a solution on stackoverflow with some code that i needed to add in my pom file and this fixed the issue.

#### CI/CD
CI/CD is a method to deploy automation into developing. CI/CD stands for continous integration, continious delivery and continious deployement

To implement CI/CD i used github. Below you can see the worflow i used.

### Outcome 5: You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.
#### What does this learning outcome mean?
Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.
Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures;
Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For this Learing Outcome i will explain the diffrences in the different cultures and how this affects us as a group. I am also gonna make a personality test.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?
I have made a personality test for the LO Cultural Differences. The result i got is that i am a leader. I can see myself being this since i was the group leader in previous semensters and i am the scrummaster this semester. As a leader i take initiative in the group.

### Outcome 6: You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques
#### What does this learning outcome mean?
You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design
(e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For this learning outcome i will be making a C4 Model. This will be part of my architecture document. In addition i have a Analyse document with different
user stories and requirements of my application.

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?
For this learning outcome i made a C4 model to have a view of the architecture of my application. I also made requirements and out of these requirements i made user stories examples of these are below.


### Outcome 7: You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.
#### What does this learning outcome mean?
Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths. Business processes during which the software that you are developing
will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially automating them). or Business processes needed for the success of your software
development project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For this Learning outcome i will do research into the business process and how this affects my project. 

#### What have i done for this learning outcome?
Nothing atm.

### Outcome 8: You act in a professional manner during software development and learning
#### What does this learning outcome mean?
You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

#### What will i do for this learning outcome?
For this Learning outcome i will continiously ask feedback and work with this feedback. Besides that i will also make a STARR reflection. 

#### What have i done for this learning outcome 
For this learning outcome i made a STARR reflection on the sitation and communiction i have with the stakeholders and teachers this also includes feedback
