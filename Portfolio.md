## Learning Outcomes 

### Outcome 1: You design and build user-friendly, full stack web applications
You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g.,
Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

For the frontend i chose Javascript and for the framework react. More on why i chose this you can find in my research with the link below.
- [Frontend Development](https://github.com/AnwarIbrahimi/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Research.md#frontend-development)

For the backend i went with java as this was a new language for me and i wanted to learn something new. And for the framework i went with springboot. More on this and why i chose this you can find in the link below.

### Outcome 2: You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.
Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as
well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

### Outcome 3: You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project
You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on
well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.

To use agile methods and principles in the group we use github. In github we make use of a **sprint backlog**. We made user stories as issues. We are also making use of a **product backlog**. This is defined in a board. This board is being updated at the start of every sprint. Below you can find the links of the backlogs. At the end of sprint we do a sprint review. To do this we make a powerpoint with the the tasks we planned to do at the start of the sprint and what we succeeded at the end of the sprint. We also reflect on the sprint. All this we do in front of the client and we get feedback from them. This feedback is documented and we also take this into the retrospective. As scrummaster in a retropsective

### Outcome 4: You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.
You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

#### CI/CD
CI/CD is a method to deploy automation into developing. CI/CD stands for continous integration, continious delivery and continious deployement

To implement CI/CD i used github. Below you can see the worflow i used.

Below you can see the docker push image i used. I'm also using docker desktop to push out the containers.

### Outcome 5: You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.
Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.
Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures;
Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.

I have made a personality test for the LO Cultural Differences. The result i got is that i am a leader. I can see myself being this since i was the group leader in previous semensters and i am the scrummaster this semester. As a leader i take initiative in the group.

### Outcome 6: You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques
You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design
(e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

#### User stories
Below is a example of a user story i made.

### Outcome 7: You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.
Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths. Business processes during which the software that you are developing
will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially automating them). or Business processes needed for the success of your software
development project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).

### Outcome 8: You act in a professional manner during software development and learning
You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.
