#### What is the definition of software back-end?
Software backend is a part of a website or program that a user can not see. It works together with the frontend to make a fully working website or application.
Backend processes include: processing incoming webpage requests. Running scripts like html. Accessing data from a database and updating records in the database. And many other things these were some examples.
#### What is an application framework?
An application framework is a software library that provides support of the development of applications. Framworks are being used to make the devolopment phase go with less effort. An application framework is basically a tool you can use to construct your application.
#### What are some commonly used application frameworks?

## Frontend Development
### Javascript
JavaScript is one of the most used programming languages as of today. JavaScript is a language to create interactive web pages. JavaScript is a scripting language. Where HTML and CSS give structure and style to a website, JavaScript gives websites a interactive element that engages with a user. An example of this include a search box you use on Facebook. JavaScript is mostly used for web-based applications.

### JavaScript framework
A JavaScript framework is a collection of code libraries that provides you with pre-written code. It is possible to build an application without a framework. This could come in handy when you are making a smaller project. But if you are making a bigger project it is recommended to use a framework because It provides you with a template that handles common programming patterns. So this means that every time you start coding something you don’t have to make everything out of scratch.

Now that we know what the meaning is of a framework I have to choose a framework. My preference goes to a framework that’s popular. JavaScript has a lot of different frameworks you can choose of. The most popular at the moment are Angular, React and VUE.js. When I’m deciding for a framework I have to choose a framework that suits my needs the best and my project of course. Too know what suits me best I need to dive deeper in what each framework does best and what the differences are.

### Angular
Angular is the most popular framework as of now. It’s a pretty recent framework it has a good structure. It is mostly used in TypeScript. This is a strongly typed O.O.P version of JavaScript

### React
React is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces. React is known for being fast, scalable and simple. React was created by a Facebook engineer and React is being used by Facebook. Properties of React are as followed
  -	React is declarative
  -	React is simple yet very powerful
  -	React is component based
  
  Component-based software engineering (CBSE), also called component-based development (CBD), is a branch of software engineering that emphasizes the separation of       concerns with respect to the wide-ranging functionality available throughout a given software system. It is a reuse-based approach to defining, implementing and       composing loosely coupled independent components into systems. This practice aims to bring about an equally wide-ranging degree of benefits in both the short-term     and the long-term for the software itself and for organizations that sponsor such software.
  -	React supports server-side
  -	React supports mobile support
  -	React is extensible
  -	React is easy to learn
React doesn’t use the regular JavaScript for templating it uses JSX, JSX is a simple JavaScript that allows HTML quoting and uses these HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents. React is also known for updating a page without reloading it.

### VUE.js
Vue.js is the less used framework out of the three frameworks. It is familiar to old plain JavaScript. Downside of VUE.js is that you need to do the structure all by yourself.

### Which Forntend framwork suits my project best?

## UX (User Experience)

UX stands for “User Experience” this is referring to how people interact with a product. User experience is about how a person thinks and feels. Both plays a big role in how a person thinks about your product. Having a good UX in your product makes a big difference. It can even make the difference if people keep using your application. Basic techniques that come with user experience are as followed.

  -	Usable: A product needs to be simple, easy to use, and familiar.
  -	Useful: A product must fill a need. If the product isn’t filling a perceived gap in the users’ lives, then there is no real reason for them to use it.
  -	Desirable: The visual aesthetics of the product need to be attractive and evoke positive emotions.
  -	Findable: If the user has a problem with a product, they should be able to quickly find a solution.
  -	Accessible: The product or service needs to be accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities.
  -	Credible: The company and its products need to be trustworthy.

## Backend Devolepment
If we are talking about development there are always two different parts you have the frond-end and the back-end. The frond-end runs on the client-side and the back-end runs on the server-side. Like frond-end which uses frameworks, the back-end is also using frameworks. A framework helps to speed up development and aims to improve maintainability. Every framework has its own positives and negatives. But before I choose a framework I first need to choose a language. There are two languages I can choose from. The first one is .NET this means I’m going to use the same language as the semester before. Which means I’m going to dive deeper into the language. The other option is to Use Java. This is a new language for me which means I have to learn the language first. 

### .NET Frameworks
The language which is most commonly used in .NET is C#. .NET has two frameworks to choose from which are .NET Framework and .NET Core. Both frameworks have been made by Microsoft. It uses the same features but there also some differences between the two. .NET Framework is the older one and is mostly only used for Windows systems. .NET Core is a much more recent framework which support more platforms. 

For .NET IIS is used for the application server. This is used to host web applications. If I had to choose between the two different frameworks my choice would go to .NET Core since it uses the same features as .NET Framework but its more recent and supports multiple platforms.

### JAVA Frameworks
Like .NET Frameworks which only has two frameworks too choose from JAVA has a wide variety of frameworks to choose from. Now I have to choose a Framework that suits me and my projects the best. To do this I have to dive deeper in the different frameworks.
