## Architecture
In this document i will describe the architecture of my application.

### C4 Model
The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase. It's a way to create maps of your code, at various levels of detail, in the same way you would use something like Google Maps to zoom in and out of an area you are interested in.

### Level 1 Context Diagram
A Context diagram is the first level and a good starting point for diagramming. 
The primary focus of this diagram is show a big picture of the system.

### Level 2 Container Diagram
The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

### Level 3 Component Diagram
The Component diagram shows how a container is made up of a number of "components", what each of those components are, their responsibilities and the technology/implementation details.
